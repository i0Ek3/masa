> masa: A memory allocation simulation algorithm.

masa is a simulation algorithm to allocate the memory. It supports level control allocation and status transfer. For now, masa rest on the experimental stage, we'll add new features soon.


## Level control allocation

- Tiny_
- Little_
- Enough_


## Status transfer

- MemoryInitialing
- MemoryAllocated
- MemoryAllocating
- MemoryAllocateFailed
- MemoryWaitToAllocate
